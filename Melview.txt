Melview is a tool for viewing and classifying ICA components from FSL. It's expected to be replaced later in 2016 by "FSLeyes", but until that happens it's still pretty useful. Here are a few tips for installing it in OSX.

First, follow the instructions on the FSL melview page: http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/Melview. The try to run it by typing "melview" in the terminal. If this gives you the error “no module named pygments.lexer”, you need to install pygments using macports:

sudo port install py27-pygments

Try running melview again. You may get the error: "ImportError: cannot import name NavigationToolbar2QTAgg". If so, you need to edit the file melodic_traits.py, which is probably in /opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/melview. Change line 121 from:

from matplotlib.backends.backend_qt4agg import NavigationToolbar2QTAgg as _NavigationToolbar

to:

from matplotlib.backends.backend_qt4agg import NavigationToolbar2QT as _NavigationToolbar

After that, it should work.
